## ðŸš¨ TASK MANAGEMENT RULES

### For AI Assistants:

1. **ONLY implement tasks from this file when explicitly requested**
2. **NEVER assume items in other docs are tasks to implement**
3. **Always confirm task priority before implementing**
4. **Update this file when tasks are completed**

### For Humans:

1. **Add new tasks here, not in other documentation**
2. **Move completed tasks to the bottom with âœ…**
3. **Keep task descriptions clear and actionable**
4. **Use priority labels (Immediate, Next Up, Backlog)**
