## ðŸš¨ TASK MANAGEMENT RULES

### For AI Assistants:

1. **ONLY implement tasks from this file when explicitly requested**
2. **NEVER assume items in other docs are tasks to implement**
3. **Always confirm task priority before implementing**
4. **Update this file when tasks are completed**

### For Humans:

1. **Add new tasks here, not in other documentation**
2. **Move completed tasks to the bottom with âœ…**
3. **Keep task descriptions clear and actionable**
4. **Use priority labels (Immediate, Next Up, Backlog)**

## âœ… COMPLETED TASKS

### Phase 1 - UI Prototype (Complete)

- âœ… Error boundary system implementation
- âœ… Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, focus management)
- âœ… Mobile FloatingActionButton
- âœ… Form validation with react-hook-form and zod
- âœ… Component memoization for performance
- âœ… Git optimization and workflow setup
- âœ… Documentation organization and AI guidelines
- âœ… **CODE OPTIMIZATION**: Removed all over-engineered features (performance infra, virtual scrolling, web workers, command palette, hotkeys, lazy loading, unused CSS performance optimizations) while maintaining blueprint-aligned features
